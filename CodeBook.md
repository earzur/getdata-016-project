# Code Book for the file generated by run_analysis.R

run_analysis.R will load data from Samsung experiment and compute mean values for each of the *-mean() and *-std() values contained in that data set.

it generates a file named `output.txt` with the format described below.

## Output file format

the file contains 180 observations of 68 variables, 1 line per observation, with values separated by space.

Non-numeric variables such as factors are enclosed in double-quotes (`""`)

### File header 

The first line of the file contains a header with descriptive names for the columns enclosed in quotes (`""`)

### Variables description

1. `subject` - numeric 1:30 (subject identifier for the study)
2. `activity` - name of the activity practised. Possible values are:
    1. `WALKING`
    2. `WALKING_UPSTAIRS`
    3. `WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS`
    4. `SITTING`
    5. `STANDING`
    6. `LAYING`

We have picked only the `-mean()` and `-std()` columns from the original dataset, and computed the average value for every (`subject`,`activity`) groups.

The variables present in this file are defined as such (from `features_info.txt` in the
original dataset)

```
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial
raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time)
were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter
and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove
noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity
acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth
filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to
obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these
three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityA
ccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag).

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing
fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJer
kMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals).

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
